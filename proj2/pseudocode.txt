objective: opens a text file, reads the first integer, then reads the next integers, stores them in an array and computes their sum

    // this is the maximum accepted number of integers in the file
    The maximum count is going to be 1000 integers                                   

    // read the first integer in the file as n, n is the count of numbers to read
    // limit n to at most 1000
    Set n to the FIRST_INTEGER_IN_THE_FILE
    If n > 1000 then set n = 1000
    If n < 1 then set n = 0
    Create an integer array A of size 1000
    Set sum to 0                                        

    // loop over the next n integers
    for i from 0 to nâˆ’1 do the following                             
        value = NEXT_INTEGER_IN_THE_FILE
        A[i] = value
        sum = sum + value:
    end
    return sum:        

    // output the final sum
    output "", sum
end of the program
