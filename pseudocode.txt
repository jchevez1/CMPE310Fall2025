objective: asks the user for two input strings and computes the Hamming distance between the two strings

    // this is the maximum accepted input length of the string
    The max length is going to be 255 characters                          

    // these ask the user to input two strings
    input "Please enter first string: "          
    Input "Please enter second string: "

    // compare only up to the shorter string, n is the number of characters we'll compare
    Set n to MIN(LENGTH(string1), LENGTH(string2))                  
    Set total to 0                                        

    // loop over each character
    for i from 0 to nâˆ’1 do the following                             
        p = byte(string1[i]) 
        q = byte(string2[i])
        compare (p xor q), and save it to x  
        whenever x is 1:
        total = total + 1:
    end
    return total:        

    // output the final distance
    output "The Hamming distance is: ", total               
end of the program
